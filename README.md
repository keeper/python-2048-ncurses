python-2048-ncurses
===================
The making of this project is for adding a auto solver to 2048 game, and a practice for python.
The original game, please see http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ (which I believe most people had already known).
And thanks to the original concept from Threes by Asher Vollmer.
